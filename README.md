Github backup for my thesis as a move from computer to computer and get into the nitty gritty.

Currently in right-hand-work: 
* Movement and menu placement works
* Menu can open, close, and look at player so it always faces them initially
* Menu selection circle (soon to be icon?) works, but needs polished
* Menu can be "retreived" by pressing the grab button on the right hand (interaction hand)

Next steps:
- [ ] Add Doors and Windows to floorplan models
- [ ] Create lower-poly models
- [ ] Test movement and screens in a floor
- [ ] Add lighting to a floor
* Once one floor is fleshed out enough, the other interactable floors will be easier to set up

More menu work:
- [ ] Add sound feedback
- [ ] Create more main menu items for the main menu
