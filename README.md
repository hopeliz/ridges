Github backup for my thesis as a move from computer to computer and get into the nitty gritty.

Currently in right-hand-work: 
* Movement and menu placement works
* Menu can rotate, open, close
* Menu selection circle (soon to be icon?) works, but needs polished

Next steps:
- [ ] Update all menu scripts to get the info from the right-hand interacting with the screen to provide all other menu scripts with:
* "Menu Target" (the container for all screen items)
* "Menu Background Container"
* "Menu Contents Container"

Doing this should make all screens be able to use the same scripts while only updating one script for each mini/information screen.

- [ ] Add sound feedback
- [ ] Create more main menu items for the main menu
